# React Native - Frontend ios Application

## Step 1: Setup Environment

[I followed this tutorial:](https://medium.com/@randerson112358/setup-react-native-environment-for-ios-97bf7faadf77)

## Step 2: Run ios simulator

Open terminal and run this react-native command `react-native run-ios`
This will start the iPhone simulator and and run the code.
Login using the test username:`edwin` & password: `123456`

## Step 3: Run the django API

This step is what you will need to get the app to login.
Move to this directory: `cd django_rockitchef/rockitchef_project/`
Install all deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Then run the django app: `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

## DONE

## Bonus:

All files can be found in the package.json file under `frontend/`
